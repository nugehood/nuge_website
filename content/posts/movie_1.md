When you were reading about who Lars is, then you have to agree in one way or another to the fact that this movie is a living embodiment of who Lars is.

The fact that the story contains extramarital, religious, and taboo, means that those subjects intertwine with his interests and personal life.

Lars is a product of extramarital himself, he lives as an atheist, and he always tries to bring out taboo subjects with a common concept. Thus making it so much more interesting.

So naturally, Breaking the Waves will be a harsh one, he wants you to be upfront, he wants you to be at your seat clenching your butt whilst a series of uncomfortable images and events played nonstop. He had set up everything to be unique, the camera, the setting, and the actors. Looking through a wobbly camera makes you think that you were there, setting up intertitles with each chapter, each with a very bizarre combination of scenery taken from the camera and some painting, grade-A actors that we're able to realize his visions, each one never misses to mess you up or tear you down...

Altogether, you will be able to look into a piece of cinema that is very provocative and "perverted". If you really want a good or bad watch, this is it folks!
