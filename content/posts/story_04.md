That's a piece of lyrics from the song ["You Set The Scene"](https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=-N9kGKFIAQk) by the band [LOVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_(band)). It is one of the most beautiful lyric I have ever seen, in fact, all of the tracks in this album are beautiful.

This lyric could be viewed as a motivational push for the people, or rather a point of view of someone with an optimistic glasses. The album contains tons of social and political issues.

But in this article I would not talk about it...
I just want to share a piece of lyrics. I hope this could motivate you to listen to the album. Have a nice day everyone, and stay safe!
