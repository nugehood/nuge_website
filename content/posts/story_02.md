See the people

See the people

See the people

Born from a womb


See the world

See the world

See the world

Living under the same roof

See the sky

See the sky

See the sky

It blinds our eyes

The people cried

The people fight

Why, o why are we fighting?

Because we cried

Why, o why are we crying?

Because we fight

The people

Once more

Born from the same womb

Lives on the same roof

Blinded by the sky

O little child

You will never be right

You will never be satisfied

There was never a truth

But you will live

Live a cry

Live a fight

Live a laugh

O dearest child

Look at the people

Please, my dearest o child

Look

See

What do you see?
